Description: ==============
         Installation
        ==============
        The latest Windows installer can be found on PyPI:
            https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=tdl&:action=display
        
        Or if it's available you can use pip instead by running the command:
            pip install tdl
        
        This module can also be manually installed by going into the "setup.py"
        directory and running the command:
            python setup.py install
        
        Already compiled libtcod libraries are included as part of the package data.
        They won't need to be compiled as part of the installation, but can be replaced
        with newer versions if necessary.
        
        =======
         About
        =======
        TDL is a port of the C library libtcod in an attempt to make it more "Pythonic"
        
        The library can be used for displaying tilesets (ANSI, Unicode, or graphical) in true color.
        
        It also provides functionality to compute path-finding and field of view.

         Changelog
        ===========
        1.1.7
         * Noise generator now seeds properly
         * The OS event queue will now be handled during a call to tdl.flush. This
           prevents a common newbie programmer hang where events are handled
           infrequently during long animations, simulations, or early development
         * Fixed a major bug that would cause a crash in later versions of Python 3
        
        1.1.6
         * Fixed a race condition when importing on some platforms
         * Fixed a type issue with quickFOV on Linux
         * Added a bresenham function to the tdl.map module
        
        1.1.5
         * a for loop can iterate over all coordinates of a Console
         * drawStr can be configured to scroll or raise an error
         * You can now configure or disable key repeating with tdl.event.setKeyRepeat
         * Typewriter class removed, use a Window instance for the same functionality
         * setColors method fixed
         
        1.1.4
         * Merged the Typewriter and MetaConsole classes,
           You now have a virtual cursor with Console and Window objects
         * Fixed the clear method on the Window class
         * Fixed screenshot function
         * Fixed some drawing operations with unchanging backgrounds
         * Instances of Console and Noise can be pickled and copied
         * Added KeyEvent.keychar
         * Fixed event.keyWait, and now converts window closed events into Alt+F4
        
        1.1.3
         * Some of the setFont parameters were incorrectly labeled and documented
         * setFont can auto-detect tilesets if the font sizes are in the filenames
         * Added some X11 unicode tilesets, including unifont.
        
        1.1.2
         * Window title now defaults to the running scripts filename
         * Fixed incorrect deltaTime for App.update
         * App will no longer call tdl.flush on its own, you'll need to call this yourself
         * tdl.noise module added
         * clear method now defaults to black on black
        
        1.1.1
         * map submodule added with AStar class and quickFOV function
         * new Typewriter class
         * most console functions can use Python-style negative indexes now
         * new App.runOnce method
         * rectangle geometry is less strict
        
        1.1.0
         * KeyEvent.keyname is now KeyEvent.key
         * MouseButtonEvent.button now behaves like KeyEvent.keyname does
         * event.App class added
         * drawing methods no longer have a default for the character parameter
         * KeyEvent.ctrl is now KeyEvent.control
